# Polkadot and Kusama Data Analysis

This project aims to analyze staking and nomination related data of Polkadot and Kusama chains

## Tasks

Task #1:  
So very roughly steps would be:
1. Figure out which validators where in the validator set for a given era.
2. From this you will be able to figure out which validator should have how much rewards
3. Query if there has been a payout rewards event for given validator on given era
4. Map/plot it all

Relevant tables: Extrinsics, DispatchableCalls, Events;
Relevant sections: staking, election* methinks, maybe session as well
